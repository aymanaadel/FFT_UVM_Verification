NOTES:
	1. to run the project and see the waveforms then use "run.do" file
		- 1st, go to FFT_scoreboard file and delete/comment the C++ function call
		- 2nd, do run.do in QuestaSim

	2. to run the project with calling the C++ function (DPI) then use "run_dpi.do" file
		- 1st, make sure the function call exists in FFT_scoreboard file
		- 2nd, do run_dpi.do in QuestaSim
